# Rice Grain Classification using ANN 🌾🤖

This project demonstrates rice grain image classification using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
The model classifies five different rice varieties based on image data.

## 📌 Rice Varieties
- Arborio
- Basmati
- Ipsala
- Jasmine
- Karacadag

## 🧠 Approach
- Images are loaded from a structured dataset
- Converted to grayscale and resized
- Dataset split into training, validation, and test sets
- ANN model trained using TensorFlow/Keras
- Model evaluated and saved

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is organized into folders, where each folder represents a rice class.
> Dataset not included due to size constraints.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab
3. Mount Google Drive
4. Set dataset path
5. Run all cells

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Upgrade ANN to CNN for better accuracy
- Add confusion matrix and performance metrics
- Deploy as a web application
